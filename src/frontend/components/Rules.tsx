        <p>Avalon is a game of hidden loyalty. Players are either loyal Arthurian servants or secretly evil servants of Mordred</p>
        <p>Good wins the game if three out of five quests are successful. Evil wins if three out of five quests fail, Merlin is assassinated, or voting is thrown into chaos</p>
        <p>Communication is vital--but can be sabotaged. Players can say anything during the game. The forces of Arthur work to uncover truth</p>
