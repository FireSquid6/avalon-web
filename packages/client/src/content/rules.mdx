# Summary

Avalon is a team-based **hidden role** game where the forces of Merlin and Mordred battle to succeed and fail quests. While outnumbered, the servants of Mordred can use their informational asymetry to either assassinate Merlin or cause enough disorder fail quests. The servants of Merlin must protect Merlin at all costs and deduce which players amongst them are secretly saboteurs.

# Victory Conditions
The evil (Mordredic) team wins by:
- assassinating Merlin
- getting three failed quests
- getting four rejected nomination votes

The good (Arthurian) team wins by:
- getting three successful quests
- avoiding assassination

Note: Assassination in the standard rules takes place *after* the good team has already won three quests. This gives the evil players a chance to discuss. More experienced players can use the "Quickshot Assassin" ruleset to force the assassination to happen mid game

# Game Flow
Each turn goes through several phases:

- **Discussion** - the players discuss which players should go the quest
- **Nomination** - the current monarch picks 2-5 (depending on player count and quest #)
- **Voting** - all players vote to either approve or reject the quest. If the quest is rejected, the monarch continues to the next player. 
- **Questing** - The players on the quest secretly choose whether to fail or succeed the quest. Evil players can choose to succeed to blend in, but good players have no reason
- **Reveal** - The number of failed votes on the quest is revealed. If just *one* player voted to fail (except for quest 4 sometimes), the quest is failed. Otherwise, the quest is a success.
- **Lady of the Lake** - If quest 2, 3, or 4 and the lady of the lake is enabled the player holding the lady of the lake uses it

After the turn, the monarch passes to the next player clockwise if no victory condition has been met yet.

# Roles
Avalon is a game about information. Aside from the assassin who can assassinate Merlin, no roles have any abilities other than knowledge. 

## Arthurian Servant
Arthurian servants work for quests successes. They must deduce everything and have no information.

## Merlin
The Arthurian forces live or die by Merlin. Merlin knows who all of the evil players are (except for Mordred), but cannot make his knowledge too obvious. His goal

## Mordredic Servant
A normal mordredic servants knows who their teammates are (except Oberon). They work to fail quests and figure out who Merlin is.

## Assassin
The assassin is the same as the Mordredic Servant except that they have the final call on who to assassinate. This role is more crucial in "Quickshot Assassin" mode and cannot get help from teammates.

## Mordred
Mordred is a *buffed* mordredic servant. Mordred knows and is known by their teammates, but cannot be seen by Merlin. 

## Oberon
Percival is a *nerfed* modredic servant typically for only 10 playergames. Usually, all evil players know who each other are but Oberon neither knows or is known by his own team. Additionally, Oberon can only fail quests and does not have the option to pass a quest to "blend in" like other evil players can.

## Percival
Percival acts as a helper to Merlin on the Arthurian side. They see two players, one of which is Merlin, and one of which

## Morgana
Morgana is no different than a normal Mordredic Servant *except* for the fact that Percival sees both them and the actual Merlin as possible Merlins. If they manage to trick Percival, the game will most likely end as a decisive Mordredic victory. 

# Lady of the Lake
Lady of the Lake acts as a separate token held by a player. It starts on the player directly to the left of the monarch and is used at the end of the second, third, and fourth quest. When used on another player, it reveals the team (*not* specific) role to the player that used it. The player that used it is then free to say whatever they want (including lie!). The lady of the lake then goes to the player it was used on.

It's almost always best as a good player to tell the truth if you use the lady of the lake. As an evil player, there are many strategies. You can vouch for a teammate, sell out a teammate to gain trust for yourself, lie about a good player being evil, or just tell the truth.

It's not recommended to play with lady of the lake in games of \<7 players.
